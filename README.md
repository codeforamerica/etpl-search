Every state provides a list of training programs that a job seeker can get help paying for with a subsidy from the public workforce system. This list is generally called an Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL).

For people struggling to escape the cycle of low-wage work, subsidized training or paid apprenticeships can dramatically increase opportunities for higher-wage work.

States publish different amounts of data about programs on their ETPL. Some include employment rates, wages, and long-term wage growth, while others provide just titles and descriptions. For example, the New Jersey ETPL exposes a lot of data about each program. This project is an experiment to increase mobile usability and data presentation of the New Jersey ETPL.
